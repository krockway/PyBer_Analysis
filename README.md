# PyBer_Analysis
Analyze Pyber rideshare data
## Project Overview 
The purpose of this analysis is to review how the city type impacts different metrics between January and April 2019. Metrics include: ride volume, driver count, total fare, average fare per ride per driver, and total fare by city type.
## Results
* Summary - There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type.
* Total Ride Volume

## Summary & Next Steps
* As seen in the charts above, the Urban areas should continue to be the biggest focus for PyBer. Urban areas consistently have high metrics - total rides (1,625), total drivers (2,405) & total fares ($39k). 
* If PyBer is interested in diversifying their portfolio, Suburban areas should be the next area of focus. The average fare per ride ($30.97) is better than in Urban areas, but the number of rides is low. So even though you make more per trip, the number of trips is too low to make significant revenue.
* The Rural area should not be an area of focus for PyBer. Although the average fare per ride ($34.62) is the highest of all city types, the number of rides (125) is again too low to be significant. PyBer should encourage some of their Rural drivers to focus on Suburban areas instead - they will be earning less per ride, but will execute more rides, generating more revenue at the end of the day.
